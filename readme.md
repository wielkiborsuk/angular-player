AngularJS based audio player. A client module that requires backend to serve both track hierarchy model and songs themselves.

Player supports playlists, playback queue and HTML5 audio element with custom controls.
Other than base controls like: stop, play, pause, next, previous, the player also allows track time seeking, volume control,
and audio playback speed adjustment.

Planned features include:
- session and user-specific content, like playlists
- external services integration - e.g. pointing to google disk directory as a playlist
- video support - possibly with the same layout, but e.g. with video appearing at the top
- file manipulation (if backend supports it) - delete files from 'not editable' lists
- sortable lists - by name, manual
